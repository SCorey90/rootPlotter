# What is this, and why does it exist?
This is a tool I made for plotting 1D ROOT objects in a way that I find more convenient by adding all of the objects to a class, chosing colors for them, adding them all automatically to a legend, and plotting it all in one go.

The origin of the idea is that I wanted to set a default color scheme for all of my plots that is friendly to my colorblindness. I hope that people with normal color vision and other colorblind people find the color scheme, which can be sampled by running the ColorPaletteDemo executable, easily discernable as well.

From there I realized there was potential to add more features to make plots the way I want them to look in fewer lines of code, so I added styling features, automatic legend generation and more. My goal now is to get full coverage of all the features I use in ROOT for plotting 1D objects, so that I can do all of my plotting in this class and keep everything easy on my eyes aesthetically and color vision-wise.
